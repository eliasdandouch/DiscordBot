# DiscordBot

This bot is still really simple and is not advanced in any way (as of 02/01/20) but I plan on adding voice commands in the future.

### v.02

```
- Added /language cog that blocks out bad words than deletes them then sends a DM to the user..
- Added $kick & $ban command.
- The on_ready() now has its own individual cog instead of being apart of the main bot.py.
```

### v.03 (02/11/20)
```
- Added /help cog that has all the help commands.
- $kick & $ban now have permissions.
- Updated the $help command. The help command will now be deleted if typed in a chat. (I will continue to update this as time goes on) 
- Added a $about command that tells you the purpose of the Bot and this also will be deleted if typed in chat.
```
