# DiscordBot

This bot is still really simple and is not advanced in any way (as of 02/01/20) but I plan on adding voice commands in the future.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### v.02

```
Added /language that blocks out bad words than deletes them then sends a DM to the user.
Added .kick & .ban command
the on_ready() now has its own individual cog instead of being apart of the main bot.py
```
